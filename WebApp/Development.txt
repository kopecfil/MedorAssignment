coinbase api
    It appears that the coinbase api caches the data on their side.
    It seems like it is only possible to get new data after 10 s since the last response.
    Therefore automatic fetching of the data should have a similar timer, but it should also be configurable in some way.

testing
    this codebase is very simple, there are a few things that could be unit-tested
    but a lot of the functionality needs integration tests, which makes it pointless to also write unit tests because the integration tests would cover all of the code
    setting up integration tests would take too much effort for this assignment
    the database would need to be tested, which would be a pain even tho the database is extremely simple here
    I guess one way around the pain is to decide that all changes to the DB have to be treated like special events and not handled automatically
    that would mean that doing integration tests for the DB would be easier on this assignment, but that would not happen in a real codebase, so there is no point in even doing that here

project template
    it seems like the template for this type of project now contains more files than I am used to
    I am pretty sure that I could remove most of these in order to reduce the clutter and bloat in the codebase
    because this is a new thing and I am not familiar with what all of the files are, I'm not going to remove any of them as of now in order to make sure that I wouldn't remove some that are important, tho I think they were never important, it's just that the defaul website links to the other ones and I'm not using any of that
    I might go through it and clean it up before submitting the assignment
